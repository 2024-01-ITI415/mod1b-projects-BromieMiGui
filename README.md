# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
ProtoType was a mix of all three games we made
Level one features the pickups from rollaball, with the goal being to hit all the pickups with the slingshot
Level two features the moving GameObject mechanic of the AppleTree in the form of obstacles preventing the player from hitting the pickups
